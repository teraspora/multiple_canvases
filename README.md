# Multiple Canvases

- Uses OOP / ES6 classes to facilitate multiple HTML canvases with different stuff going on in each one!
- In this first, prototype, alpha version, it demonstrates displaying colourful realtime graphs of various parametrically-defined functions.
- In the future, other interesting effects, such as particle clouds, will be showcased.
- This is very much a prototype, much more incredibly awesome functionality will follow!
- Deployed to https://teraspora.github.io/multiple_canvases/
- Press a digit key `n` (`1` to `9`) to change the resolution and display n<sup>2</sup> canvases.
